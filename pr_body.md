# Fix: Resolve timezone-related Monday validation errors in week schedule

## 🐛 Problem Description

The main page was throwing **400 Bad Request** errors when trying to load the week schedule. The error was occurring because the frontend's date calculation functions were using UTC-based formatting (`toISOString().split('T')[0]`), which could shift dates by one day depending on the user's timezone. This caused the backend to receive dates that weren't actually Mondays, triggering the "Week start date must be a Monday" validation error.

### Error Details
- **Error**: `Week start date must be a Monday`
- **Status Code**: 400 Bad Request
- **Root Cause**: Timezone conversion in `getMonday()` functions
- **Impact**: Main page failing to load for users in certain timezones

## ✅ Solution

Implemented **timezone-safe date formatting** by replacing UTC-based calculations with local date operations.

### Changes Made

#### 1. **WeeklyCalendar Component** (`frontend/src/components/calendar/WeeklyCalendar.tsx`)

**Before (problematic):**
```typescript
const getMonday = (date: Date): string => {
  const d = new Date(date);
  const day = d.getDay();
  const diff = d.getDate() - day + (day === 0 ? -6 : 1);
  d.setDate(diff);
  return d.toISOString().split('T')[0]; // ❌ UTC conversion can shift dates
};
```

**After (timezone-safe):**
```typescript
const getMonday = (date: Date): string => {
  const d = new Date(date);
  const day = d.getDay();
  const diff = d.getDate() - day + (day === 0 ? -6 : 1);
  d.setDate(diff);
  
  // ✅ Use local date formatting to avoid timezone issues
  const year = d.getFullYear();
  const month = String(d.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const dayOfMonth = String(d.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
  return `${year}-${month}-${dayOfMonth}`;
};
```

#### 2. **WeekScheduleView Component** (`frontend/src/features/week/components/WeekScheduleView.tsx`)

- Applied the same timezone-safe fix to `getMonday()` function
- Updated `handlePreviousWeek()` and `handleNextWeek()` navigation functions
- Ensured consistent date formatting across all week navigation operations

## 🧪 Testing

### ✅ Backend Tests
- **151 passed**, 4 skipped (155 total)
- All week schedule service tests passing
- No regressions in existing functionality

### ✅ Frontend Tests  
- **154 passed**, 1 skipped (155 total)
- All component tests passing
- No breaking changes to UI functionality

### ✅ Manual Testing
- Verified timezone-safe Monday calculation works correctly
- Confirmed main page loads without 400 errors
- Tested week navigation functionality

## 🎯 Impact

### **Fixed Issues**
- ✅ Main page 400 Bad Request errors resolved
- ✅ Week schedule loading now works across all timezones
- ✅ Consistent Monday calculation regardless of user location

### **Improved Reliability**
- 🌍 **Global compatibility**: Works correctly for users in any timezone
- 🔒 **Data integrity**: Ensures dates sent to backend are always valid Mondays
- 🚀 **User experience**: Eliminates confusing error states on page load

## 📋 Quality Assurance

- [x] All backend tests passing (151/155)
- [x] All frontend tests passing (154/155)
- [x] Manual testing completed
- [x] No breaking changes
- [x] Backward compatibility maintained
- [x] Docker environment tested

## 🔍 Code Review Notes

The fix is **minimal and focused**:
- Only changes date formatting logic, no business logic modifications
- Maintains existing function signatures and behavior
- Uses standard JavaScript Date methods (no external dependencies)
- Self-contained changes with clear before/after comparison

## 🚀 Deployment

This fix is **safe to deploy immediately**:
- No database changes required
- No environment variable updates needed
- No breaking API changes
- Purely frontend date calculation improvements
