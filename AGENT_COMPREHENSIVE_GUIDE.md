## ü§ñ General Agent Rules

### Code Quality & Implementation
- **Immediate Execution**: Always use code edit tools to implement changes rather than outputting code to the user
- **Runnable Code**: Generated code must be immediately executable with all necessary imports, dependencies, and endpoints
- **Modern UI**: When building web apps from scratch, create beautiful, modern UIs with best UX practices
- **No Binary Content**: Never generate extremely long hashes or non-textual/binary code
- **Linter Error Handling**: Fix clear linter errors but don't loop more than 3 times on the same file
- **Tool Selection**: Use `search_replace` for files larger than 2500 lines, otherwise prefer `edit_file`

### File Management
- **Edit Over Create**: Always prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- **Minimal File Creation**: Never create files unless absolutely necessary for the goal
- **No Proactive Documentation**: Never create documentation files (*.md) or README files unless explicitly requested

### Tool Usage
- **Parallel Tool Calls**: Execute multiple operations simultaneously rather than sequentially whenever possible
- **Comprehensive Context**: Be thorough when gathering information; ensure full picture before replying
- **Semantic Search**: Use broad, high-level queries first, then narrow down with specific searches

## üèóÔ∏è Project-Specific Rules

### Environment & Development Workflow
- **Local + Docker Validation**: Run and test code locally for quick feedback, but always verify in Docker containers before considering features stable
- **Docker Command**: Use `docker compose` (not `docker-compose`) for better reliability
- **Non-Interactive Commands**: Always use non-interactive flags (`-y`, `--force`, `--assume-yes`) for terminal commands

### Version Control & Git Workflow
- **Explicit Confirmation Required**: MUST obtain explicit user confirmation before executing any `git commit` or `git push` commands
- **Pull Request Only**: Only push code changes via Pull Requests from feature branches
- **Never Direct Push**: NEVER commit or push directly to `main`, `develop`, or protected branches
- **Proactive Git Assistance**: Help with staging changes, suggesting commit messages, and drafting PR descriptions

### Database Management
- **No Migrations**: Never create database migrations; always update Prisma schema directly
- **Safe Push Only**: Always use `npm run db:safe-push` (exports data, applies changes, reseeds) instead of raw `prisma db push`
- **Data Preservation**: The safe-push workflow prevents data loss during development iterations

### Testing Strategy
- **100% Pass Rate**: Ensure ALL tests (Unit and E2E) achieve 100% pass rate before merging PRs
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Create unit tests for business logic, integration tests for API endpoints, E2E tests for complete workflows
- **Local CI Validation**: Use ACT to run GitHub Actions locally before pushing changes
- **Test-Driven Development**: Never consider backend work complete without corresponding unit tests

### Code Quality Standards
- **Minimal & Efficient**: Strive for clear, efficient code; be prepared to refactor for conciseness
- **Code Hygiene**: Help identify and remove unused variables, functions, methods, classes, and imports
- **Dead Code Cleanup**: Flag potentially redundant code blocks, especially after experimentation phases

## üß† Stored Memories

### Critical Workflow Rules
- **Pre-PR Testing Protocol**: Never create a PR without first running and passing ALL local tests and linting checks:
  1. Backend tests: `cd backend && npm test`
  2. Frontend tests: `cd frontend && npm test`
  3. Linting: `cd backend && npm run lint` and `cd frontend && npm run lint`
  4. Build validation: `cd backend && npm run build` and `cd frontend && npm run build`

- **Git Cleanup Process**: After merging PRs, always follow complete cleanup:
  1. Switch to main and pull latest: `git pull origin main`
  2. Delete local feature branch: `git branch -d [branch-name]`
  3. Delete remote feature branch: `git push origin --delete [branch-name]`
  4. Create new feature branch for next work

### Technical Implementation Achievements
- **UX Standardization**: Successfully completed combo box standardization across the application, replacing 6 native HTML select elements with CustomSelect component (PR #92)

- **Week Schedule System**: Implemented efficient "virtual schedule with override pattern" reducing database storage by ~95%:
  - Added WeekOverride and TaskOverride models with TaskOverrideAction enum
  - Created WeekScheduleService with on-demand schedule resolution
  - Added API routes with proper family membership validation
  - Comprehensive TypeScript types and unit tests

- **Family Management E2E**: Implemented comprehensive E2E tests with 12 test scenarios covering virtual member management, family details editing, and access control

### Testing & CI/CD Insights
- **E2E Authentication**: Use systematic debugging approach with network response listeners, page content logging, and element availability verification

- **Playwright Module Resolution**: Install dependencies locally in CI workflows to avoid "Cannot find module" errors:
  1. `cd e2e-tests`
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npx playwright install chromium`
  4. `npx playwright test`

- **GitHub Actions Logs**: Never use `gh run view --log` (hangs in interactive mode); use `gh run view [run-id] --log-failed` or append `| cat`

- **ACT Local Testing**: Use `act --container-architecture linux/amd64` and stop Docker containers first to avoid port conflicts

### User Experience Fixes
- **Onboarding Flow**: Fixed critical issue where users got stuck on "Request Submitted!" screen when admin rejected join requests
- **Family Context**: Implemented proper state management with periodic refresh to detect status changes
- **WebSocket Notifications**: Fixed family-updated notifications and FamilyContext currentFamily refresh

## üìö Project Documentation

### Project Overview
**Family Board** is a minimalistic family task planner application built with modern web technologies, featuring a clean design with purple accents (#7c3aed) and Deliveroo-inspired UI.

#### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Express + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright (Chromium only)
- **Containerization**: Docker + Docker Compose
- **Database Admin**: Adminer
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Internationalization**: i18next (English & French)

#### Quick Start
1. Clone repository
2. Run `chmod +x scripts/setup.sh && npm run setup`
3. Start with `npm run dev`
4. Access at http://localhost:3000

### Database Workflow
The project uses a safe database workflow to prevent data loss during development:

#### Safe Commands
- `npm run db:safe-push` - Apply schema changes with automatic backup and reseed
- `npm run db:export` - Export current database state
- `npm run db:reset` - Reset database with seed data

#### Critical Rules
- ‚úÖ Always use `npm run db:safe-push` for schema changes
- ‚úÖ Export data before any manual database operations
- ‚ùå Never use `prisma db push` alone without reseeding
- ‚ùå Don't use `--force-reset` without backing up data

### Week Schedule Implementation
The project features an advanced week schedule system using a "virtual schedule with override pattern":

#### Architecture Benefits
- **Storage Efficiency**: ~95% reduction in database records
- **Template Updates**: Automatic propagation to all weeks using templates
- **Flexibility**: Support for ADD, REMOVE, REASSIGN, MODIFY_TIME operations
- **Performance**: Fast queries with minimal database joins
- **Audit Trail**: Clear history of changes with source tracking

#### Core Models
- `WeekOverride`: Stores week-specific overrides and customizations
- `TaskOverride`: Stores specific task assignment overrides with actions
- `TaskOverrideAction`: Enum for ADD, REMOVE, REASSIGN, MODIFY_TIME

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/families/:familyId/week-schedule` - Get resolved week schedule
- `POST /api/families/:familyId/week-schedule/override` - Apply overrides (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/families/:familyId/week-schedule/override` - Remove overrides (admin only)

### Component Cleanup Status
Recent audit identified unused components that can be safely removed:

#### Unused Components (Safe to Remove)
- `FamilyManagement.tsx` - Functionality integrated into `UserProfile.tsx`
- `NotificationCenter.tsx` - Functionality integrated into `UserMenu.tsx`

#### Benefits of Cleanup
- Reduces bundle size by ~30KB
- Eliminates maintenance overhead
- Improves code clarity and navigation
- No breaking changes (components not used in application)

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Backend (70+ tests) and Frontend (41+ tests)
- **E2E Tests**: Comprehensive family management scenarios (12 tests)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with parallel execution and comprehensive coverage
- **Local Testing**: ACT integration for workflow validation

### Development Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start all services in development mode
- `npm run test:all` - Run all tests (unit + E2E)
- `npm run test:ci` - Validate GitHub Actions workflow locally
- `npm run down` - Stop all services
- `npm run clean` - Clean up Docker resources

### Environment Access
- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:3001
